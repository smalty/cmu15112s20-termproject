Project Description
************************************************
The title of the game is subject to change, but it is currently "Super Ninja 3D World". It is a 3D game made using the module Panda3D 
similarto the game "Super Mario 3D World". Players are on a 3d terrain with enemies, coins, and power-ups. The player can control the ninja
character using WASD, jump using space, and shoot out a dagger by aiming with the mouse and shooting with the left mouse button. After 
reaching a certain area, a boss fight will trigger. The game ends if the player's health becomes 0 or the boss's health becomes 0. The
game score is then calculated from number of enemies killed, remaining health left, and coins gathered.

Competitive Analysis
************************************************
There are almost no games that I have seen that are similar to my idea, but there is a "Super Mario Game" from 15-112 Fall 2020 and 
"SuperDog" from 15-112 Spring 2018 that features a 2D version of Mario. Therefore I will be stating how my project is different in general.
I will be using Panda3D to program my game, which implements 3D features. "The Coaster Generator" from Spring 2018 uses Panda3D, but it 
replicates a different game that is in a first person point of view that features moving around in a roller coaster. I will have a third
person POV game that is similar to Mario.

Structural Plan
************************************************
There are 2 python files that are essential to run the game. One of them is the main file currently named "term_project". This contains 
the base of the game which includes the starting menu, the environment, and camera. The other file is called within the first and contains
the classes of the elements in the game. Currently there is only the player, enemy, and walking enemy class/superclass, but it will contain
coins, powerups, and the final boss. There will also be .egg files made with blender to use for the models of the various elements.

************************************************
Algorithmic Plan
************************************************
The most complicated part of the project is detecting collision in Panda3D. It is very difficult to handle collisions because it is unclear
as to where the collisions are being stored and how to store the event of collisions. I will studying on the Panda3D main website on how to
implement collision and handlers (things that trigger events when an event happens). Without the use of collisions, I will not be able to
do most of my project. The game has to detect when a collision happens, and what is colliding with what. If a knife the player shoots out 
collides with an enemy, it takes damage. If an enemy collides with the player, the player takes damage. If the player collides with certain 
power-ups or coins, the score will be increased or the player will have special powers. Another complicated part is making the models of 
the various elements using blender. If I cannot make models, I will have to use free models online.

************************************************
Timeline Plan
************************************************
4/17 - Implement collision between player/enemy so player loses health
4/18 - Map attack under player class to mouse
4/19 - Create power-up and coin superclasses
4/20 - Implement collision between player and power-up/coin and update player based on power-up/coin
4/21 - Create Final Boss class
4/22 - Create Game Over Screen
4/23 - Create models
4/24 - Create Models
4/25 - Create Models
4/26 - In case things do not go as planned, extra time
4/27 - In case things do not go as planned, extra time
4/28 - In case things do not go as planned, extra time

Version Control Plan
************************************************
I am backing up my code using Google Drive and uploading all the files into a folder. There is an image shared with the zip file named 
"Version Control Plan" that shows the files in the folder.

TP2 Update
************************************************
I applied collisions so that if the enemy hits the player, the player loses health. Once the player loses all health, a game over screen 
is shown with options to retry or quit. With the left mouse button, players can now shoot out a projectile that damages the enemy. This 
projectile cannot be spammed, and it disappears when it hits an enemy or it goes out a certain range. I decided to make the point of view
top down because the aiming of the projectile is skewed when looking at the player from a different angle. When the player defeats all 
the enemies (as of now only 2 enemies), a level complete screen will appear. I have also applied a health indicator that shows how much
health the player has on the top left corner. I plan on making 1 or 2 power-ups, a scoring system, and the boss. 

************************************************
TP3 Update
************************************************
I have made 2 power-ups. One powerup allows the player to shoot three knives in separate directions with one click, and the other doubles
the damage of the knife. The powerups are dropped randomly (50% each) if the enemy is killed. In the positive y-direction (up), I have set
a final boss with its own "AI". The boss has 3 moves that it randomly chooses from. The boss's total health is 30, and when it's health is 
between 20-30, it's three moves are a single shot fireball, a spread wave of fireballs, and a large fireball that it charges up. When the 
boss's health is between 10-20, the moves are the same except the fireballs are faster. At the last stage when the boss's health is betweeen
1-10, the boss either shoots out three fireballs at once, shoots out a wave of firballs with double the amount of the first and second stages,
and shoots out a large fireball with no delay. I have also included the scoring system that one can see in the top right corner, and once the
game is over or the level is complete, your score will be given back. I have also decided to rename my project to Super Panda 3D World
since I was not able to apply new models to the enemies nor the player.
