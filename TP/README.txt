Project Description
************************************************
The title of the game is "Super Panda3D World". It is a 3D game made using the module Panda3D similar to the game "Super Mario 3D World".
Players are on a 3d terrain with enemies, coins, and power-ups. The player can control the panda character using WASD, jump using space,
and shoot out a dagger by aiming with the mouse and shooting with the left mouse button. Certain powerups can be acquired from killing 
smaller enemies. After reaching a certain area, a boss fight will trigger. The game ends if the player's health becomes 0 or the boss's 
health becomes 0. The game score is then calculated from number of enemies killed.
